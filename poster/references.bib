              analyses of an arbitrary set of hydrodynamic equations : search for
              steady states ; stability of steady states ; nonlinear integration
              ; search for specified nonlinear solutions; stability of nonlinear
              solutions. The scheme is an extension of the “Henyey” relaxation
              method and is especially useful in problems where both numerical
              stability and mathematical versatility are desired. In particular,
              if Eulerian equations are used, we may use this approach to
              investigate the stability of steady flows.},

              boundary-value problem in which are prescribed the perturbation
              values of velocityand density at an initial time and additionally
              the velocityperturbation at the base of the corona for all times.
              The solution is constructed by linear superposition of normal
              solutions, which contain the time only in an exponential factor.
              The stability problem becomes a singular eigenvalue problem for the
              amplitudes of the velocity and pressure perturbations, since
              additionally to the boundary condition at the base of the corona
              one must add the condition that the amplitudes behave regularly at
              the critical point. It is proved that only stable eigenvaluesexist.

              unanswered were the stability of the steady-state solution, the
              solution itself of time-dependent ﬂows, whether the time-dependent
              ﬂows would evolve to the steady state, and under what conditions a
              transonic ﬂow would develop. In a Hamiltonian description, we ﬁnd
              that the steady-state solution is equivalent to the Lagrangian
              implying that timedependent ﬂows evolve to the steady state. We ﬁnd
              that the second variation is deﬁnite in sign for isothermal and
              adiabatic ﬂows, implying at least linear stability. We solve the
              partial differential equation for the time-dependent ﬂow as an
              initial-value problem and ﬁnd that a transonic ﬂow develops under a
