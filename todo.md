TODO:
- [ ] figure out why there is oscillation near the singularity even when we are using regular solution
- [ ] make better citations (format of citations are not unified)
- [ ] make our own figure for the magnetic nozzle since there are too many details we don't need on the current figure
- [ ] add more citations to the nozzle introduction. They can be found from the review paper _Physics of ExB..._
- [ ] add some eigenfunctions to the results for completeness
- [ ] make a beamer presentation for the annual report

Reminders:
- Send report 1 week before
- 15 mins presentation
- 2 rounds of questions from committee 
- Committee will finalize my courses I need to take

Report:
- introduction
    - what is plasma
    - what is instability and what are the usual tools and ways to solve these problems
    - what is magnetic nozzle
        - magnetic field in nozzle
        - Fluid description of plasma
        - equilibrium velocity profiles
            - similarity between laval nozzle and magnetic nozzle
        - Polynomial eigenvalue problem and spectral method
    - similar configurations: BP flow
        - governing equations
        - velocity profiles
- governing equations
- numerical experiments 
    - difficulties encounter using spectral method, show figures
    - discovered that the existence is related to blackhole
    - realizing that the existence of the singularity serves as a boundary condition
    - coming up with the shooting method
    - a difficulty to overcome: expansion near the singularity
    - compare the good result to the bad one
