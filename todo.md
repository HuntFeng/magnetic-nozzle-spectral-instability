TODO:
Experimentations
[ ] check if my expansion near singular point is okay.
[ ] The expansion near singular point is actually a Bessel equation?
[ ] If shooting from singular point to a non-zero left boundary, what are the coefficients of the power series? This problem comes from the above question, we better make it a bessel function, so we can have an exact solution rather than power series.

Thesis writting:
[ ] swap chapter spectral method and governing equations? Make the logic flow more smoothly, chapters about physics stays together and chapters about math stay together.
[ ] comments on different methods
