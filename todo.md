TODO:
[x] finish the proof of symmetry in the thesis
[ ] delete DVR related sections in the thesis
[ ] swap chapter spectral method and governing equations? Make the logic flow more smoothly, chapters about physics stays together and chapters about math stay together.
[ ] comments on different methods
[ ] open end. $sin(n\pi/4 (n+1)),n = 1,3,5,...$ are good basis functions for spectral method

IMPROVE:
[ ] Finite-Element
