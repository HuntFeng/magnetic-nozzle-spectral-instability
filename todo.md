TODO:
Theory:
[ ] why does power series expansion at the singular point only captures the finite solution and not the diverging one?

[x] the expansion near singular point is actually a Bessel equation?

- It seems the the solution is a linear combination of Bessel functions but with complex order (not sure if this is valid).

Experimentations
[ ] if shooting from singular point to a non-zero left boundary, what are the coefficients of the power series? This problem comes from the above question, we better make it a bessel function, so we can have an exact solution rather than power series.

Thesis writting:
[ ] swap chapter spectral method and governing equations? Make the logic flow more smoothly, chapters about physics stays together and chapters about math stay together.
[ ] comments on different methods
