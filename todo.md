TODO:
[x] finish the proof of symmetry in the thesis
[x] delete DVR related sections in the thesis
[x] write parameters for simulations of fixed_open boundaries
[x] add ground state to all results (no need to do this since the grounds state are already there, even though they look weird)
[ ] use integral form to check the eigenvalues
[ ] swap chapter spectral method and governing equations? Make the logic flow more smoothly, chapters about physics stays together and chapters about math stay together.
[ ] comments on different methods
