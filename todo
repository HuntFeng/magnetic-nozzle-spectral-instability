[ ] Why some modes are unstable ? Are they numerical instabilities?
[ ] Try to solve the eigenvalue problem specified by (9),(10) in stability-and-boundary-condition.pdf

If things are done:
[ ] Verify the results by solving it as eigenvalue problem by setting v as linear combination of orthorgonal functions


Expectation (Goal):
[ ] All cases with Dirichlet boundary condition should be stable
