  To improve the credibility of the results, different numerical calculation methods will be employed.

  \begin{itemize}
      \item Try to match the eigenfunctions to a non-zero left boundary and investigate the corresponding instabilities.
        [figure]
      \item Setup a analytically solvable problem with similar configuration. Compare the analytical results to the the experimental computations to better understand the physics.
