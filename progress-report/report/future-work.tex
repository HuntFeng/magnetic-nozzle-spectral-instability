\chapter{Future Work}
This research project can go to several direction. 

\begin{itemize}
  \item To improve the credibility of some results, different numerical calculation methods will be employed and confirmed with variational forms.
  \item Investigate and interpret the instability of an accelerating flow with non-zero left boundary values. See Fig.\ref{fig:accelerating-v-nonzero-bc}
  \item Setup a analytically solvable problem with similar configuration. Compare the analytical results to the the experimental computations to better understand the physics.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{By matching the real part of the perturbation to a nonzero real value, we get different eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. What is the physical interpretation of "non-zero" boundary value? How do we interpret these eigenvalues?}
