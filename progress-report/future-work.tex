\chapter{Future Work}
This research is still in its beginning. To improve the credibility of the results, different numerical calculation methods will be employed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate the solution of the problem near the singular point. 
    \item Try to match the eigenfunctions to a non-zero left boundary and investigate the corresponding instabilities.
    \item Setup a analytically solvable problem with similar configuration. Compare the analytical results to the the experimental computations to better understand the physics.
\end{itemize}
