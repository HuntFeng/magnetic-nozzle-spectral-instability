	abstract = {A general numerical scheme is presented that allows a variety of analyses of an arbitrary set of hydrodynamic equations : search for steady states ; stability of steady states ; nonlinear integration ; search for specified nonlinear solutions; stability of nonlinear solutions. The scheme is an extension of the “Henyey” relaxation method and is especially useful in problems where both numerical stability and mathematical versatility are desired. In particular, if Eulerian equations are used, we may use this approach to investigate the stability of steady flows.},

We aim to construct a practical procedure for the data analysis to extract the classical counterpart to Hawking radiation from experimental data. Following our procedure, we determine the surface gravity of the acoustic black hole from the obtained numerical data. Some noteworthy points in analysing the experimental data are clariﬁed through our numerical simulation.},

It is shown that the stability problem must be formulated as a mixedinitial and boundary-value problem in which are prescribed the perturbation values of velocityand density at an initial time and additionally the velocityperturbation at the base of the corona for all times. The solution is constructed by linear superposition of normal solutions, which contain the time only in an exponential factor. The stability problem becomes a singular eigenvalue problem for the amplitudes of the velocity and pressure perturbations, since additionally to the boundary condition at the base of the corona one must add the condition that the amplitudes behave regularly at the critical point. It is proved that only stable eigenvaluesexist.},

Left unanswered were the stability of the steady-state solution, the solution itself of time-dependent ﬂows, whether the time-dependent ﬂows would evolve to the steady state, and under what conditions a transonic ﬂow would develop. In a Hamiltonian description, we ﬁnd that the steady-state solution is equivalent to the Lagrangian implying that timedependent ﬂows evolve to the steady state. We ﬁnd that the second variation is deﬁnite in sign for isothermal and adiabatic ﬂows, implying at least linear stability. We solve the partial differential equation for the time-dependent ﬂow as an initial-value problem and ﬁnd that a transonic ﬂow develops under a wide range of realistic initial conditions. We present some examples of time-dependent solutions.},
