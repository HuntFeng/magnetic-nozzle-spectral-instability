The scheme is an extension of the “Henyey” relaxation method and is especially useful in problems where both numerical stability and mathematical versatility are desired. In particular, if Eulerian equations are used, we may use this approach to investigate the stability of steady flows.},

Design of provably positivity-preserving (PP) numerical schemes for ideal compressible MHD is highly desirable, but remains a challenge especially in the multidimensional cases. In this paper, we ﬁrst develop uniformly high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes which provably preserve the positivity of density and pressure for multidimensional ideal MHD. The schemes are constructed by using the locally divergence-free DG schemes for the symmetrizable ideal MHD equations as the base schemes, a PP limiter to enforce the positivity of the DG solutions, and the strong stability preserving methods for time discretization. The signiﬁcant innovation is that we discover and rigorously prove the PP property of the proposed DG schemes by using a novel equivalent form of the admissible state set and very technical estimates. Several two-dimensional numerical examples further conﬁrm the PP property, and demonstrate the accuracy, eﬀectiveness and robustness of the proposed PP methods.},

	abstract = {Numerical schemes provably preserving the positivity of density and pressure are highly desirable for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but the rigorous positivity-preserving (PP) analysis remains challenging. The diﬃculties mainly arise from the intrinsic complexity of the MHD equations as well as the indeterminate relation between the PP property and the divergence-free condition on the magnetic ﬁeld. This paper presents the ﬁrst rigorous PP analysis of conservative schemes with the Lax-Friedrichs (LF) ﬂux for one- and multi-dimensional ideal MHD. The signiﬁcant innovation is the discovery of the theoretical connection between the PP property and a discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition. This connection is established through the generalized LF splitting properties, which are alternatives of the usually-expected LF splitting property that does not hold for ideal MHD. The generalized LF splitting properties involve a number of admissible states strongly coupled by the DDF condition, making their derivation very diﬃcult. We derive these properties via a novel equivalent form of the admissible state set and an important inequality, which is skillfully constructed by technical estimates. Rigorous PP analysis is then presented for ﬁnite volume and discontinuous Galerkin schemes with the LF ﬂux on uniform Cartesian meshes. In the 1D case, the PP property is proved for the ﬁrst-order scheme with proper numerical viscosity, and also for arbitrarily high-order schemes under conditions accessible by a PP limiter. In the 2D case, we show that the DDF condition is necessary and crucial for achieving the PP property. It is observed that even slightly violating the proposed DDF condition may cause failure to preserve the positivity of pressure. We prove that the 2D LF type scheme with proper numerical viscosity preserves both the positivity and the DDF condition. Suﬃcient conditions are derived for 2D PP high-order schemes, and extension to 3D is discussed. Numerical examples further conﬁrm the theoretical ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {Ideal MHD equations arise in many applications such as astrophysical plasmas and space physics, and they consist of a system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The exact density q and pressure p should be non-negative. Numerically, such positivity property is not always satisﬁed by approximated solutions. One can encounter this when simulating problems with low density, high Mach number, or much large magnetic energy compared with internal energy. When this occurs, numerical instability may develop and the simulation can break down. In this paper, we propose positivity-preserving discontinuous Galerkin and central discontinuous Galerkin methods for solving ideal MHD equations by following [X. Zhang, C.-W. Shu, Journal of Computational Physics 229 (2010) 8918–8934]. In one dimension, the positivity-preserving property is established for both methods under a reasonable assumption. The performance of the proposed methods, in terms of accuracy, stability and positivity-preserving property, is demonstrated through a set of one and two dimensional numerical experiments. The proposed methods formally can be of any order of accuracy.},

It is shown that the stability problem must be formulated as a mixedinitial and boundary-value problem in which are prescribed the perturbation values of velocityand density at an initial time and additionally the velocityperturbation at the base of the corona for all times. The solution is constructed by linear superposition of normal solutions, which contain the time only in an exponential factor. The stability problem becomes a singular eigenvalue problem for the amplitudes of the velocity and pressure perturbations, since additionally to the boundary condition at the base of the corona one must add the condition that the amplitudes behave regularly at the critical point. It is proved that only stable eigenvaluesexist.},

Left unanswered were the stability of the steady-state solution, the solution itself of time-dependent ﬂows, whether the time-dependent ﬂows would evolve to the steady state, and under what conditions a transonic ﬂow would develop. In a Hamiltonian description, we ﬁnd that the steady-state solution is equivalent to the Lagrangian implying that timedependent ﬂows evolve to the steady state. We ﬁnd that the second variation is deﬁnite in sign for isothermal and adiabatic ﬂows, implying at least linear stability. We solve the partial differential equation for the time-dependent ﬂow as an initial-value problem and ﬁnd that a transonic ﬂow develops under a wide range of realistic initial conditions. We present some examples of time-dependent solutions.},

	abstract = {A method for implementing cylindrical coordinates in the Athena magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code is described. The extension follows the approach of Athena’s original developers and has been designed to alter the existing Cartesian-coordinates code (Stone et al. 2008) as minimally and transparently as possible. The numerical equations in cylindrical coordinates are formulated to maintain consistency with constrained transport, a central feature of the Athena algorithm, while making use of previously implemented code modules such as the Riemann solvers. Angular-momentum transport, which is critical in astrophysical disk systems dominated by rotation, is treated carefully. We describe modiﬁcations for cylindrical coordinates of the higher-order spatial reconstruction and characteristic evolution steps as well as the ﬁnite-volume and constrained transport updates. Finally, we present a test suite of standard and novel problems in one-, two-, and three-dimensions designed to validate our algorithms and implementation and to be of use to other code developers. The code is suitable for use in a wide variety of astrophysical applications and is freely available for download on the web.},

As a straigthforward generalization of the model of Weber and Davis (1967), the wind solution along the magnetic field is obtained by an algebraic Bernoulli equation for the density. The important feature found in the numerical solution is the poleward deflection of the wind flow due to the magnetic force of spiraling field lines. Asymptotic behaviour of the solution at large distances shows that the flow does not become radial but is collimated in the direction of the rotation axis.},
