\chapter{conclusion}
In chapter 3, we derived the linearized equations of motion of the flow in one dimensional magnetic nozzle. Furthermore, we rewrite the linearized governing equations as an eigenvalue problem. Using the spectral methods introduced in chapter 2, we discretized the operators of the problem. Hence transforming it into an algebraic eigenvalue problem.

With the aid of computer, we are able to solve the algebraic eigenvalue problem. The results show that the flow in magnetic nozzle with Dirichlet boundary condition is stable except the case with decelerating velocity profile.
